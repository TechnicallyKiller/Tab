# HANDOFF — living log

**Every change gets an entry. Every push. No exceptions.**

This is the file you read first when you sit down and write last before you stop. Its job is to make
sure nobody loses an hour rediscovering something a teammate already knows — and on a hackathon
timeline, that hour is the difference.

**How to use it**

1. **Before you start:** read *Current State* and the last five entries in the log.
2. **Before you push:** update *Current State* if it changed, and append an entry at the **top** of
   the log.
3. **If you learned something that contradicts a doc:** fix the doc in the same commit, and say so
   in your entry. A stale doc is worse than no doc because it gets trusted.

Keep entries short. Three lines is fine. An entry that takes ten minutes to write does not get
written.

## Current State

**Phase:** on-chain — HCS live, money moving between accounts. Frontend still on mocks.
**Next action:** `@tab/protocol` — real receipt schemas, so the receipt topic carries typed
receipts instead of `bootstrap.hello`.
**Last updated:** 2026-08-22 by Claude (Hedera testnet: topics live, Mirror Node verified)

### Live testnet

| | |
|---|---|
| Operator | `0.0.8812188` · ED25519 · 1000 HBAR · unlimited auto-association |
| Receipt topic | [`0.0.10182696`](https://hashscan.io/testnet/topic/0.0.10182696) |
| Ceiling topic | [`0.0.10182697`](https://hashscan.io/testnet/topic/0.0.10182697) |
| Settlement topic | [`0.0.10182698`](https://hashscan.io/testnet/topic/0.0.10182698) |
| Spend token | [`0.0.10182853`](https://hashscan.io/testnet/token/0.0.10182853) — `TUSD`, 6 dp, 1000 supply. **Stand-in**: the Circle faucet reported a drip that never arrived. Swapping to real USDC is one env var |

All three carry an ED25519 submit key, so the log is append-only and Tab-owned. A message
round-trips through consensus and back out of Mirror Node in about two seconds.

### Track board

**No assigned owners. Everyone is equal — claim a track, work it, release it.** Put your name in
*Claimed by* when you start and clear it when you stop, so two people never edit the same package in
parallel. That is the only rule, and it is about merge conflicts, not authority.

Tracks are dependency-ordered — see [docs/BUILD_ORDER.md](docs/BUILD_ORDER.md). Do not start a
phase whose predecessor is unfinished; you would be building against an interface that does not
exist yet.

| Track | Scope | Phase | Claimed by | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **P0** | `tools/probes` → `docs/probes.md` | 0 | — | 3 of 5 answered; 1 and 2 need USDC + a seller |
| **G** | `tools/guards` | 0 | — | **done** — 5 guards, negative-tested |
| **F1** | `money` ✅ · `protocol` · `params` | 1 | — | money done (13 tests) |
| **F2** | `ledger` | 1 | — | open |
| **F3** | `scoring` · `graph` | 1 | — | open |
| **A1** | `hedera` · `observability` | 2 | — | hedera: client + topics live; HTS/schedule next |
| **A2** | `mirror` ✅ · `db` | 2 | — | mirror done, 7 live checks green |
| **A3** | `x402` | 2 | — | open |
| **A4** | `cache` | 2 | — | open |
| **FAST** | `fastpath` · `apps/gateway` | 3 | — | open |
| **SLOW** | `apps/engine` · `apps/settlement` | 3 | — | open |
| **S1** | `sdk` · `apps/cli` | 4 | — | open |
| **S2** | `agentkit-plugin` | 4 | — | open |
| **S3** | `apps/web` | 4 | — | open |
| **S4** | `mcp` — scope it before building | 4 | — | open |
| **D1** | `tools/verify` | 5 — pull earlier if you can | — | open |
| **D2** | `agents/honest-agent` | 5 | — | open |
| **D3** | `agents/loop-attacker` | 5 | — | open |

**Before Phase 1 is claimed:** agree the `@tab/protocol` message shapes together. Everything
downstream reads and writes them, and changing them on day four touches every package.

### Environment

| Thing | Status | Value / where |
|---|---|---|
| Hedera testnet account | ⬜ | |
| Supabase project | ⬜ | `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` |
| Upstash Redis | ⬜ | `REDIS_URL` in `.env` — **note the region** |
| HCS topics (3) | ⬜ | created by `pnpm bootstrap` |
| Float accounts (2) | ⬜ | Treasury + Hot Float, see [docs/KEYS.md](docs/KEYS.md) |
| Testnet USDC obtained | ⬜ | Probe 1 |

### Blocked / open questions

| What | Blocking whom | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| Probe 2: which facilitator do our demo sellers use? | `x402`, `apps/gateway` spend leg | — |
| Probe 5: fast-path latency to in-region Upstash | `cache` LRU design, the 50ms claim | — |
| Standalone MCP server, or load our plugin into the official Agent Kit MCP server? | `mcp` scope | — |
| Settlement schedule: provisional-amount-at-open, or short-expiry-near-close? | `apps/settlement` | — |
| `AGE_FULL_DAYS` testnet value | `graph`, `params`, the config dump | — |
| Refusal reason enum — the UI already renders 6 codes, `@tab/protocol` must match exactly | `protocol`, `fastpath`, `web` | — |
| Ceiling input record shape — the CEILING view renders 9 rows and a canonical hash | `scoring`, `protocol`, `web` | — |

### Contract changes — read this before you assume a doc is current

Anything that changed a shared interface, a schema, or a documented decision. **This is the section
most likely to save someone an hour**, so be generous here even when the change felt small.

| Date | What changed | Who must know |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-08-18 | Float is **two accounts** (Treasury KeyList + Hot Float single key), not one. The x402 exact scheme signs per request. [ADR-0003](docs/adr/0003-two-account-float.md) | `hedera`, `gateway`, `settlement`, `verify` |
| 2026-08-18 | We **self-facilitate the earn leg**; we are the HBAR fee payer when we earn. [ADR-0004](docs/adr/0004-self-hosted-facilitator.md) | `x402`, `gateway` |
| 2026-08-18 | Agent Kit enforcement is a **policy**, not a hook — hooks cannot block. [ADR-0008](docs/adr/0008-agentkit-policy-not-hook.md) | `agentkit-plugin` |
| 2026-08-18 | SDK is **`@hiero-ledger/sdk`**, never `@hashgraph/sdk`. Mixing them breaks signing at request time. [ADR-0002](docs/adr/0002-single-hedera-sdk.md) | everyone |
| 2026-08-18 | x402 is the **scoped `@x402/*` 2.22.0** family, not unscoped `x402@1.2.0` | `x402` |
| 2026-08-18 | **No Docker.** Supabase + Upstash. [ADR-0005](docs/adr/0005-managed-infrastructure.md) | everyone |
| 2026-08-21 | **`apps/dashboard` is now `apps/web`** and carries all three surfaces as route groups (`/`, `/app/*`, `/docs`). `boundaries.json` and every README updated | `web`, anyone reading the package map |
| 2026-08-21 | **pnpm 11 ignores the `pnpm` field in package.json.** `overrides` moved to `pnpm-workspace.yaml` — the ADR-0002 SDK pin was silently inactive before this | everyone |
| 2026-08-22 | **Keep an HCS receipt under 1KB.** Above that it chunks across messages and must be reassembled before parsing; a lone chunk is truncated JSON | `protocol`, `gateway`, `verify` |
| 2026-08-22 | **Mirror Node returns empty pages mid-result-set.** Stop only on `links.next === null`, never on an empty page, or history truncates silently | `engine` indexer, `verify` |
| 2026-08-22 | **Filter `result === 'SUCCESS'`** on transactions — failed transfers are returned and would be phantom graph edges | `engine`, `graph` |
| 2026-08-22 | **No TypeScript parameter properties anywhere.** Packages run under `node --experimental-strip-types`, which cannot handle them. `erasableSyntaxOnly` is now on | everyone |
| 2026-08-21 | **`allowBuilds` in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` must stay answered.** pnpm 11 only warns locally on an unanswered entry but exits 1 in CI, which fails the deploy | anyone adding a dependency with an install script |
| 2026-08-21 | **The UI already fixes two shapes**: the refusal reason enum (6 codes) and the ceiling input record (9 rows + canonical hash). `@tab/protocol` must match what the screens render | `protocol`, `scoring`, `fastpath` |

### YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM — <your name> — <area>

**Did:** what you actually changed, in one or two lines.
**Learned:** anything surprising. A library that does not work as documented, a value that had to be
tuned, an approach that failed. This line is the most valuable one in the entry — if you struggled
with it, write it down so nobody else does.
**Contract change:** none · or what changed and who is affected (also add it to the table above).
**Next:** what you would do next, or what you are handing over.
**Blocked:** nothing · or what you need and from whom.

### 2026-08-22 — Claude — Hedera testnet is live

**Did:** `tools/guards` (5 guards, all negative-tested), `@tab/money` extracted from the frontend,
`@tab/mirror` (7 checks against real testnet), `@tab/hedera` (client + topics), and `pnpm bootstrap`
— which created three real HCS topics and round-tripped a message through consensus.

**Learned:** Four things measured against the live chain, not read in docs.

1. **Mirror Node returns empty pages in the middle of a real result set** — 7 of 8 empty, one page
   with data, `links.next` non-null throughout. An indexer that stops on the first empty page
   silently truncates history, which is a wrong graph and therefore a wrong credit decision.
2. **HCS messages above ~1KB chunk**, and a lone chunk parses as truncated JSON. Keep receipts under
   1KB; every read goes through `reassembleChunks()`.
3. **Portal accounts now ship `max_automatic_token_associations: -1`** — unlimited auto-association,
   which softens the README's "fails silently" association warning for portal accounts. Accounts we
   create in bootstrap still need it set explicitly.
4. **Running the guards found two real defects in the frontend** I had already shipped: the ceiling
   formula was computed in floats on the landing page, and counterparty share was compared against
   the 40% cap as a float. `0.4` is not representable, so that comparison can flip at exactly 40% —
   a refusal that should fire and doesn't. Both now bigint/basis-points.

Also fixed two false positives in my own guards, both by making the check more truthful rather than
looser: the SDK guard now counts physical copies in the pnpm store instead of parsing peer-suffixed
lockfile versions, and the secrets guard asks git whether a `.env` is *tracked* rather than whether
it exists.

**Contract change:** four, in the table above.

**Next:** testnet USDC (Probe 1) is the gate for everything else on-chain. Then HTS transfers, then
`@tab/protocol` so receipts have a real schema instead of `bootstrap.hello`.

**Blocked:** Probe 1 needs a USDC faucet; Probe 2 needs a live x402 seller to query; Probe 5 needs
Supabase and Upstash.

### 2026-08-21 — Claude — apps/web, all three surfaces

**Did:** Built the frontend from the Claude Design bundle in `surface-selection-decision/`. One
Next.js 16 app, three route groups: landing (`/`), operator console (`/app/*`, eight views), docs
(`/docs`). Token layer, primitives and motion system in `src/app/globals.css`; every figure comes
from `src/lib/mock/`. Builds clean, 13 routes, all verified serving. `apps/dashboard` became
`apps/web` and the structure docs followed.

**Learned:** Three things worth the next person's time.

1. **pnpm 11 no longer reads the `pnpm` field in package.json.** Our `@hiero-ledger/sdk` override
   was silently doing nothing. Moved to `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, and added an alias so
   `@hashgraph/sdk` resolves to the Hiero package even if something pulls it in. ADR-0002 was
   unenforced until now.
2. **The branded `MicroUsdc` type earned its keep immediately.** It failed the build twice on
   places where I'd let a raw `bigint` through from a subtraction. That is exactly the class of slip
   that produces a balance a few micro-USDC off the ledger, so `sub()` and `atLeastZero()` now
   exist rather than inline arithmetic. The prototype used floats throughout; this does not.
3. **The design prototype is decided on two schemas we have not written yet** — the refusal reason
   enum and the ceiling input record. Whoever takes `protocol` should read
   `apps/web/src/lib/mock/types.ts` first; the screens are the spec.

**Contract change:** three, in the table above.

**Next:** `@tab/sdk` (track S1) is now the critical path for the frontend — swapping the mock
modules for real calls is mechanical once its surface exists. Backend still gated on Phase 0 probes.

**Blocked:** nothing.

### 2026-08-18 — Claude — repo structure

**Did:** Scaffolded the monorepo — folder tree, a README per directory stating its invariants and
dependency rules, eight ADRs, [`boundaries.json`](boundaries.json) as the machine-checked
architecture, root tooling config, CI, and [docs/](docs/). No implementation.

**Learned:** Verified every load-bearing dependency against the live npm registry and their published
type definitions rather than trusting the original README, and six things were off — three of them
architectural. Full detail in [docs/RESEARCH.md](docs/RESEARCH.md). The one that would have hurt
most: the x402 Hedera `exact` scheme requires the *paying* account to sign a transfer inside each
request, which makes a threshold KeyList on the float incompatible with a sub-50ms path. That is
knowable only from reading `@x402/hedera`'s type definitions, and it would have surfaced as a
mysterious latency problem in week two.

**Contract change:** six, all recorded in the table above.

**Next:** Phase 0 probes. Then split Phase 1 three ways per
[docs/BUILD_ORDER.md](docs/BUILD_ORDER.md) — but agree the `@tab/protocol` message shapes together
before splitting, because everything downstream reads them.

**Blocked:** nothing. Probes 2 and 5 are open questions that only running them answers.
